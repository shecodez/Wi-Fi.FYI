description: "PoV: I want to go to South Korea in June for a week-long vacation on a budget"
---

Welcome to the first episode of **Travel for VviFi Tuesday**. This time we're traveling to South Korea for 7 days in June.

## Just a bit of Q&A
- **Who goinâ€™?** me, myself, and I 
- **For what?** Vacation
- **When?** for 7-days in June (thatâ€™s ðŸ”¥ hot)
- **Where?** in South Korea 
- **Why?** â€˜cause Iâ€™m bored
- **How?** Budget-friendly (lol duh)
- **So how much?** ~2000 USD

## Hereâ€™s the FAPFAP-ing Breakdown

### Flight 
* ðŸ‘‰Economy: $990â€“1,700.
* Premium economy: $1,890 - $4,687
* Business: $3,400â€“5,800
* First: $12,500â€“16,000

* Luxury: 100,000 KRW or more per night for a high-end hotel

**Accomodation Total: $210 USD**

**Note**: _I'll actually be in South Korea for the whole month of June so I booked an Airbnb for June 2 - July 1 for $859 which is discounted due to the length of stay. This also allowed me to keep it budget-friendly at less than 30 USD a night._

### Plus extra
1,000 USD or equivalent for your home currency. I know having an emergency fund of 1,000 USD for a week-long trip probably seems a bit excessive but that fund is in its own high-yield savings account and will only be withdrawn if needed while traveling. Plus any money I save during my travels goes into this account.

## Itinerary
