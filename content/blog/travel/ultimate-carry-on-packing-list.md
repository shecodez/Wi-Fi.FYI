Okay who here gets a little stressed when it's time to pack for a trip?

I know it's tempting try to pack everything but the kitchen sink --but you are a packing GOAT not a pack mule! üêêüèÜ

No matter if I choose to travel light and take only carry on (plus the personal item) or break out the heavy duty check-in luggage, my carry on always contains:

* things I need/want to keep close to me (food, entertainment, meds) whether its a short domestic or a long international flight
* things I may need if my check-in luggage is lost (like a change of clothes) or things that maybe expensive, fragile, or hold sentimental value (like tech & jewelry) I don't want to risk possibly never seeing again if my check-in luggage is stolen

So today, I'm sharing my go-to eco-friendly carry on packing list that I use no matter where or for how long I fly. I hope it helps you save some time and effort so you can G.O.A.T. - Get Out And Travel all the way to your next destination.

### üéµ Carry On... my wayward son

Luckily there is only a handful of airlines that will not allow economy customers to bring at least 1 regular carry-on bag on board. So most airlines (even the budget ones I'm looking at you Spirit/Frontier) will allow at least one (1) carry on item under their specified weight limit (5-10 kgs or 11-22 lbs). 

Even better, the major airlines usually allow up to two (2) carry on items: 

1. one (1) carry on size spinner luggage or a travel backpack,
2. one (1) personal item (typically a purse, small backpack, laptop sleeve, briefcase, or my *personal* favorite (get it 'personal' favorite... üòâ) the Wandrd PRVKE 21 that can be stowed under the seat in front of you).


With this duo, I don't even need a check-in bag sometimes. There's something nice about arriving at your destination and not having to worry if your things got lost or stolen, and you don't have to wait for it to come around the baggage carousel possibly damaged from mishandling or covered in üí©.

### üéµ Backpack, Backpack!

Now while I don't condone using your backpack to store stolen egg rolls, no matter how tasty, from an all you can eat Chinese buffet. ü§£ I do absolute love a versatile backpack that can store all my gear whether it's just clothes for the weekend or expensive tech and camera gear. After years of searching, then another waiting for it be on sale, I finally acquired the [Wandrd PRVKE 21](https://www.wandrd.com/products/prvke?variant=39289416122448). My friends thought it was so nice last time we all vacationed together, two (2) of them recently bought one for themselves. Since I purchased mine (years ago) they've made some improvements.

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/shecodez/image/upload/v1658447216/carry%20on%20packing%20list%20images/wandrd_prvke.png" alt="Wandrd PRVKE">


> We‚Äôve taken our award-winning PRVKE line and made improvements to features and comfort. We started by updating the back panel and shoulder straps. Implementing new shapes and padding to create a more comfortable, breathable, and versatile carrying experience for all body shapes and sizes.
>
> We updated the Hidden Passport Pocket to be larger and more discreet. We also added a luggage pass-through strap. Other external changes include stronger magnets in the Tote Handles, updated zipper u-pullers, new easier-to-use Key Hook, branding updates, and velcro-and-roll Cinch Strap webbing organization. 
>
> Inside the PRVKE  we updated the laptop/tablet closure system and added 3 new pockets on the laptop/tablet sleeve. 
>
> Finally, we removed the liner flap that covered the Camera Cube compartment for quick access to your gear. The perfect bag just got perfect-er.  

The Wandrd PRVKE comes in two sizes the PRVKE 21(L) (Dimensions: 43 X 28 X 17 cm (17"H X 11"W X 6.5"D)) and the PRVKE 31(L) (Dimensions: 48 X 30 X 18 cm (19"H X 12"W X 7"D)). And with the stylish roll top design, by fully extending it you can increase the volume the bag can carry by +5L. I'm sure no matter what size you decide to go with you'll love it. It's a really amazing bag!

### üéµ They see me rollin' they hatin'

The dimension limit for a carry on varies with the airline but the standard allowance is 22" high, 14" wide, and 9" deep. I personally use a 20" hard shell aluminum frame spinner with built-in TSA lock and no zippers by Calvin Klein but this [LUGGEX Hard Shell Carry On Luggage with Aluminum Frame - No Zipper Suitcase](https://amzn.to/3Q93U8D) while not an exact match for the CK, it is pretty darn close in both looks and functionality. Since the CK was a gift from my late mother I keep it in excellent shape with this [PVC transparent suitcase cover](https://amzn.to/3WDb6fD). It'll also protect all the stickers I plan to cover it with from all my travels. üòä

### Now we get to what's in the üéµ Backpack, Backpack!

<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/ebzwY2rjZ8WFW/giphy.gif">

Why can't we just pack a couple puppies our backpack and call it a day... so freaking cute!

> üõéÔ∏è **IMPORTANT NOTE**: All the items in the list (even the optional ones) will fit inside the [Wandrd PRVKE 21](https://www.wandrd.com/products/prvke?variant=39289416122448). In fact, even after everything is packed up, I still have space left over for extras, and you will too if you follow the guide. Thank me later!

#### Documents and Important stuff

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/shecodez/image/upload/v1658447216/carry%20on%20packing%20list%20images/docs_and_important_stuff.png" alt="Documents and important stuff">

There isn't much to say on the following items just make sure you have both the originals and digital / photocopies backups.

* **Passport, Visa, etc.** 'Cause you ain't goin nowhere without it.
* **Local Currency / Credit Cards** (I get mine exchanged at my local bank so I don't have to suffer airport exchange rate rip-offs)
* **Itinerary** Make sure you have the addresses you need to get to in the language of the country you're visiting (or you will be pushed aside by a drunk Korean guy because you're taking too long to explain where you need to go to the taxi driver...) 
* **Travel Insurance**: I don't have one to recommend at the moment but please do you research on this and make sure you have it! It is always better to be safe than sorry.
* **spare clothes**: I wouldn't pack more than a small packing cube full. Mine contains a light weight multipurpose [swim shirt that is UPF 50+](https://amzn.to/3jJTAaU), shorts, a LBD (Little Black Dress), foldable flats, and undies.
* **Valuables**: Don't pack any of your valuables in your check-in bag... Please. üôèüèæ 

#### Comfort Items

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/shecodez/image/upload/v1658447374/carry%20on%20packing%20list%20images/comfort_items.jpg" alt="Comfort Items">
For the love of comfort don't leave your house without mints, a snack, and a reusable water bottle! Here are my personal favorites.

* **Earplugs, Eye Mask, Neck Pillow** (optional): you can usually get all of these in a set, but I only pack these [lavender warming eye masks](https://amzn.to/3IVJHPJ) from Japan because I always have my [Sony WH-1000XM3 Wireless Noise Canceling Overhead Headphones](https://amzn.to/3Z2DHfO) and a hoodie or oversized scarf that can double as a neck pillow. #multipurpose
* **Snacks** (optional for who?!) my go to is Gardetto Rosted Garlic Rye Chips and Blue Diamond Smokehouse Almonds.
* **Toothbrush, Floss, Face Mask, Sheet Mask** (optional): I keep a [quip Electric Toothbrush](https://amzn.to/3GxZq8b) (because I'm extra and can't live without an electric toothbrush even when traveling), quip floss dispenser, tongue scraper, a spare [face mask](https://amzn.to/3vtUlr1), and a [sheet mask pack](https://amzn.to/3WFLYVx).
* **Waterbottle/Tumbler**: You already know you need to stay hydrated, but you want to help save the planet while also saving your wallet from the exorbitant airport bottled water prices why not invest in a reusable water bottle. I have a [KOR ONE - 750mL/25oz](https://amzn.to/3IgFh7K) water bottle for sporty adventures and a [Fellow Carter Everywhere Travel Mug - 16oz](https://amzn.to/3IgKoFh) for everything else. Also in the spirit of saving the planet I always pack a reusable straw. 
* **Pen**: You don't need anything fancy, just a Lamy 5000: Safari Fountain Pen, just kidding any ol' black/blue ink pen will work incase public pens kind of gross you out and you need to fill out some forms on the plane or at immigration.
* **Glasses or Sun Glasses** (optional): I'm part of the camp that believes bigger sunglasses are better, so while I'd love to own a pair of pink Dior So Light sunglasses I'll settle for my Burberry transition prescription (I'm super near-sighted) glasses... for now.
* **Prescription Meds/First Aid Kit**: Does this even need explaining? Don't ruin your trip because you can't breath because you forgot your inhaler. Similarly, don't be upset in Bali with Bail Belly, because you forgot to pack a basic med kit for diarrhea, nausea, and fever. I keep my med kit in the luggage that goes in the overhead bin, but meds for headache and cramps and a packet of [Emergen-C](https://amzn.to/3WVEIEK) for immune support stays in my personal item that goes under the seat. 
* **Makeup** (optional): I'm not big on makeup, but I do have a few items I'll talk about in another post.
* **Misc.**: Ah, the ol' catch all. This is where you try to fit in the kitchen sink, right? No, this is where you keep things like lip balm, hand san, do, hand lotion, a [Xiaome Mijia nail clipper set](https://amzn.to/3WER9oE), and ladies I recommend adding an Aunt Flo surprise visit kit. Mine contains a few pantyliners, pads, tampons, feminine wipes, and a *new* pair of panties in a zip lock bag. Why specifically new? Because *new* things make me happy and being surprised by Aunt Flo is *usually* NOT a happy event. Although she has been known to inspire relief from time to time. ‚õîüë∂ 

#### Liquids Pouch (optional)

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/shecodez/image/upload/v1658447316/carry%20on%20packing%20list%20images/toiletries.jpg" alt="Liquids pouch" >

If you plan to pack liquids in your carry on bag, make sure that ALL liquids are NOT larger than 100ml (3.4oz) and stored in a TSA-Approved (20cm x 20cm) see-through liquid bag. The [WYNEOTUTY Hanging Travel Toiletry Bags](https://amzn.to/3GHmVMl) comes with a removable clear liquid pouch. I like that I can place it back in the toiletry bag once I clear TSA. I keep the following in my liquids bag:   
 
* 20ml [Silicone Cream Jar](https://amzn.to/3zihvUa) three (3) Piece Set 
* [ISNTREE Hyaluronic Acid Watery Sun Gel - SPF 50](https://amzn.to/3G8NSXI)
* [Brillare Real Mahabhringraj Oil](https://amzn.to/3VD6iFy)
* [CeraVe Eye Repair Cream](https://amzn.to/3VD1QXs)
* 3oz (90ml) [Matador FlatPak Bottles](https://amzn.to/3G9kNeL) 
* [Urban Hydration Bright & Balanced Aloe Vera Leaf Facial Gel Moisturizer](https://amzn.to/3G9kNeL)

I'll save the detailed info on the what is in the bottles and jars for another post. üòâ

#### Tech and Toys üéÆ

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/shecodez/image/upload/v1658499453/carry%20on%20packing%20list%20images/tech_and_toys.png" alt="Tech and Toys" >

‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer: I like tech plus I'm a nerd so I have some items here that may not be necessary for everyone so take away from/add to this list at your discretion.

* **Smartphone**(#1 must have) & *smart***watch** (optional): The camera, all the apps, and the entertainment all in one little device makes packing a smartphone a no-brainer. I personally use the [iPhone 11](https://amzn.to/3G3g6my) with the [Apple Watch Series 4](https://amzn.to/3WFIimv). They make a great combo. Did you know the apple watch can be used as a viewfinder and remote for taking pictures on your phone? 
* **Tablet/e-reader** (optional): I prefer bring my [11" iPad Pro](https://amzn.to/3Z2DAko) with the Kindle app rather than a dedicated Kindle e-reader, but if you just plan to read and only read for entertainment on your trip I've heard the Kindle Paperwhite battery practically lasts forever. 
* **Laptop** (optional): I don't carry my laptop to every trip but when I do, I take the [13" MacBook Air - M1](https://amzn.to/3QbxOJ9). Its small, light, and the battery usually lasts a full work day and then some. However, because Apple doesn't believe in ports I also have to carry this [NOVOO USB C Hub](https://amzn.to/3vwkHsD), but it fits nicely in my [electronics organizer](https://amzn.to/3vxcMve). 
* **Headphone / Earbuds**: Every since I bought the [SONY WH-1000XM3 Wireless Noise canceling Stereo Headset](https://amzn.to/3Z2DHfO) whew what a mouth full I cannot go on a plane without them. No seriously a noise canceling over-ear/on-ear/in-ear device is not optional! 
* **Portable Console** (optional): The [Nintendo Switch](https://amzn.to/3Gu7J4R) is another one of those things I don't always carry but I'm a nerd and can't help myself sometimes. 
* **Camera** (optional):  I'm currently in the market for a quality camera and I'm really considering the [Sony A7C](https://electronics.sony.com/imaging/interchangeable-lens-cameras/all-interchangeable-lens-cameras/p/ilce7c-b) but until I save up enough $$$ my ol' iPhone 11 camera is good enough. 
* **Data Storage** (optional): If you take plenty of photos & video like me this ain't optional. I have a [SAMSUNG T7 Touch Portable SSD 500GB](https://amzn.to/3Id5TXv) but I'll admit, I think the fingerprint reader is probably overkill. 
* **Chargers, Universal Adapter, Power Strip, etc.**: I have one power brick to rule them all for my electronics the [Anker USB C Charger, Anker 737 Charger GaNPrime 120W Wall Charger](https://amzn.to/3WDedEl), a [Road Warrior universal travel adapter](https://amzn.to/3GylQWU), an [Anker power strip](https://amzn.to/3GckFLc), that all goes in my electronics organizer. 
* **Power Bank**: For all the times I forget to charge my gear, and all the heartache dead electronics have caused me, you would think I own a 10000 mAh + power bank or two... but I don't (I'm working on that). 
* **Pocket Wi-Fi**: I also don't have a pocket Wi-Fi yet but I'm eyeballin' [this one](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HN54SV2/?coliid=I1D78P735UZS20&colid=3SF5647CI1SE4&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it&th=1) because I totally need to bypass the firewall in china without a VPN... üôÑ
* **Plastic Balisong** (super optional): Last item, and probably pretty useless for most people, but every since I saw [Peter McKinnon - What's in my camara bag 2019](https://youtu.be/nJud8QEjkLE) I've wanted one but could never justify the price of a real Squiddy so when I found this [Plastic Balisong Butterfly Knife](https://amzn.to/3CfQgL6) it's become a toy that I must have in my bag.  

### Whew you made it to the end!

<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/APS271ibedejm/giphy.gif" alt="That's all folks">  

I really hope this helps you üêê G.O.A.T (Get Out And Travel) faster and with less hassle and headache. It is totally okay if you decide to take more items than the ones on this list but even better if manage to take less. Everyone is different but I think we all need the same basic things when traveling. Be on the lookout for a YouTube video where I will pack all these items and show you what fits where. Until then Keep Calm, and G.O.A.T On!
