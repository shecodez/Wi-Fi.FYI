## Introduction
Traveling is an opportunity to explore, make connections, and eat. However, it can also have a significant impact on the environment. From single-use plastic water bottles to disposable coffee cups, it's easy to create a large amount of food-related waste while on the go. However, with a little effort and the right tools, it's possible to reduce this waste significantly and be more environmentally conscious while traveling.

To reduce waste and be more eco-conscious, adopt sustainable practices, such as using reusable items for food and drink. Not only do they help reduce waste, but they're also convenient and practical for travelers, especially in places where sanitation is questionable. From a reusable water bottle to collapsible cutlery, these items can make a difference in reducing your carbon footprint while on the go. Today‚Äôs post will cover the top 5 food and drink reusable and collapsible must-haves for travel. So, let's dive in!

## 1. Reusable Water Bottle

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/shecodez/image/upload/v1675225351/vvifi_fyi%20blog/My-Engraved-Fellow-16oz-_Carter-Everywhere-Travel-Mug.jpg" alt="My Engraved Fellow 16 oz Carter Everywhere Travel Mug" /> 

Staying hydrated while traveling abroad is important, but relying on single-use plastic water bottles can not only quickly add up cost-wise but also adds up to a large amount of waste. That‚Äôs why a reusable water bottle is a must-have for the eco-conscious traveler. Not only is it convenient, but it‚Äôs also cost-effective too.

Here are some important considerations for choosing the right reusable water bottle.
- A non-plastic interior like stainless steel or ceramic - _I don‚Äôt trust BPA-free_
- leak-proof-ness - _duh_
- durable - _because drop it, I will_ (Yoda)
- easy to clean - _can I throw it in the dishwasher_

I‚Äôm rocking the [Fellow 16 oz Carter Everywhere Travel Mug in Buttered Popcorn](https://amzn.to/3wLGxZS) that my friend gifted me. I like the ceramic interior coating, so, no metallic taste. I‚Äôve dropped it plenty of times, and it‚Äôs never leaked or broken. It keeps my hot stuff ‚Äìhot (12h) and my cold stuff ‚Äìcold (24h), and did I mention it‚Äôs dishwasher safe? (if you get the right color)

### FYI - Plastic Bottles
> Humans use about 1.2 million plastic bottles per minute in total. Approximately 91% of plastic is not recycled. [[1](https://basq.livelarq.com/sustainability/how-many-plastic-water-bottles-are-used-a-minute/)] Roughly half of our global annual plastic production is destined for a single-use product.[[2](https://plasticoceans.org/the-facts/)]

## 2. Collapsible ~~Coffee~~ Tea Cup

If you need your morning cup of Joe like I need my morning cup of Chai, although we‚Äôre not the same kind of people, we at least need the same kind of reusable hot liquid container. When choosing a collapsible cup to hold hot liquids, look for many of the same things you look for when choosing a reusable water bottle.

I chose the [HuNu Collapsible Coffee Cup with Lid in Charcoal](https://amzn.to/3DwEjkO) because it is both stylish and practical. It‚Äôs silicon because I do NOT trust BAP-free plastic, especially with hot liquids. It‚Äôs easy to clean and even easier to store while I‚Äôm traveling. It‚Äôs microwave safe, so if I let it get too cold, I can warm that _mug_ back up.

## 3. Reusable/Collapsible Lunch Box

When I travel, I tend to eat out A LOT, and for the few times I have access to a kitchen and the will to cook, I make A LOT. And because my eyes are often bigger than my stomach, I end up with leftovers. If I make too much food and don‚Äôt have a way to store the leftovers, I throw them away, creating food waste. If I order too much at the restaurant and want to keep the leftovers, if I ask for a to-go box, it‚Äôs usually made of styrofoam, creating polystyrene waste.

The [Sustainable Containables Silicone Collapsible Food Storage Container with Silicone Leakproof Lid](https://amzn.to/3Hlh6mJ) gives me peace of mind that I am doing my part to reduce polystyrene waste. And because the container is freezer safe, I can throw it in the freezer to keep the food fresher for longer, so I have more time before the food spoils and become food waste. It‚Äôs also oven and microwave safe for quick re-heating and completely plastic-free.

## 4. Reusable Straws

Swapping to reusable straws was a no-brainer, so it was the first eco-conscious must-have I chose to invest in. Single-use plastic straws are one of the biggest contributors to ocean pollution, and plastic can take hundreds of years to decompose. And even after hundreds of years, research shows, it most likely doesn't fully degrade but becomes tiny toxic particles called microplastic.[[3](https://oceanliteracy.unesco.org/plastic-pollution-ocean/)]

### FYI - Drinking Straws
> Americans alone use half a billion drinking straws every day.[[4](https://www.nps.gov/articles/straw-free.htm)] 

Although not aesthetic as glass or wood, stainless steel, and silicone straws are popular amongst eco-conscious travelers as they are usually sturdy & collapsible and thus a more practical choice for portability. I like to use a stainless steel straw that I can add to my keychain bonus if it comes with a bottle opener.

## 5. Reusable/Collapsable Cutlery 

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/shecodez/image/upload/v1675224212/vvifi_fyi%20blog/outlery-junior.png" alt="Outlery Junior Set" />

Reusable/Collapsible cutlery is a convenient and practical solution for travelers. It‚Äôs easy to pack, lightweight, and sanitary. Some restaurants of the world and I won‚Äôt name any names, take a _soap-is-optional_ approach when cleaning used utensils. So being the germaphobe that I am, having reusable cutlery is _not a option_ for me.

If you want to be TSA compliant, go with the [Forkanife Travel set](https://www.cold4ged.com/) an ultra-thin credit card-sized folding cutlery set safe for schools and travel. However, if you want to risk angering your TSA Agent and potentially having to throw away your knife feel free to take a gamble traveling with the same set I travel with, the [Outlery Junior Set in Yellow](https://outlery.com/products/junior-set?variant=39770270072921). üòâ I‚Äôm hoping the _junior_ part will save me but don‚Äôt say I didn‚Äôt warn ya.

## Bonus 
Keep a reusable bag with you to carry all your eco-conscious goodies from place to place.

> Five trillion plastic bags are produced worldwide annually. It can take up to 1,000 years for a bag to disintegrate completely. Americans throw away 100 billion bags annually‚Äì that‚Äôs the equivalent of dumping nearly 12 million barrels of crude oil! By switching to reusable shopping bags, we can eliminate that waste‚Äì which amounts to about 307 bags per person.

##  Conclusion
In conclusion, incorporating reusable and collapsible food and drink items into your travel essentials can reduce waste and save you money in the long run. With items such as a reusable water bottle, collapsible ~~coffee~~ tea cup, reusable lunch box, reusable straw, and collapsible cutlery, you can stay hydrated and well-fed while also doing your part to protect the environment. Next time you travel, consider swapping out single-use items for their reusable and collapsible counterparts. Your wallet, your consciousness, and the planet will thank you!
