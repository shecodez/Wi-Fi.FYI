**The Vision of Escaflowne** (天空のエスカフローネ, _Tenkū no Esukafurōne_, lit. "Escaflowne of the Heavens") is a fantasy and mecha anime television series produced by **Sunrise Studios**, created by **Shōji Kawamori**, and directed by **Kazuki Akane**.

## Plot 4/5
The show centers around a high school girl named Hitomi, who finds herself transported from Earth to the planet Gaea where she becomes involved in a war between the Zaibach Empire and the kingdom of Fanelia. Van, the King of Fanelia and pilot of the mystical mech Escaflowne, along with Allen, an Asturian Knight, fight to prevent the Zaibach Empire from taking over. As Hitomi's time in Gaea grows longer, her fortune-telling abilities grow stronger, and she becomes crucial to unlocking Escaflowne's full power and stopping Zaibach's ambitions.

### FYI
The 26-episode series premiered in Japan on April 2, 1996, on TV Tokyo, and the final episode aired on September 24, 1996. While the anime series was in production, two very different manga retellings were simultaneously released: a shōnen version of the story titled _The Vision of Escaflowne_ and a shōjo retelling titled _Hitomi — The Vision of Escaflowne_.

## Voice Acting 4/5
The voice acting is strong, and each actor captures the emotions of their character well, particularly the lead character, Hitomi, who is brought to life by the talented **Maaya Sakamoto**. 

## Animation Style 4/5
The animation style of the series is good, and the animation quality holds up even by today's standards.

## Characters 4/5
The character designs are unique and memorable, and the world-building is thorough and well thought out.

## Music 4/5
The music by **Hajime Mizoguchi** & **Yoko Kanno** is excellent and adds to the overall atmosphere of the series. The soundtrack is well composed and appropriately used to enhance the scenes and provide emotional impact.

### FYI OP
The opening theme song of _The Vision of Escaflowne_ was **Maaya Sakamoto's** debut single done in collaboration with **Yoko Kanno** under Victor Entertainment on April 24, 1996. And "Yakusoku wa Iranai" is widely considered the launching point of the then 16-year-old's career.

## Criticism
In terms of criticism, some viewers may find the series slow in certain parts, and the romance aspect could have been more developed. Additionally, the ending of the series will likely leave you with more than a few unanswered questions.

## Overall Rating 4/5
Overall, **The Vision of Escaflowne** is a well-crafted anime with a strong storyline, memorable characters, and beautiful animation. It is a must-watch for fans of the epic fantasy and mecha genres.
