## Ingredients
- 1 cup of uncooked quinoa (I like the colorfulness of tri-colored quinoa)
- 2 cups of water or vegetable broth (mushroom broth FTW)
- 1/2 cup of microgreens (if not available carrot, broccoli, radish, edamame, shredded purple cabbage, or even pomegranate seeds work too)
- 1/2 cup of diced tomatoes
- 1/2 cup of diced cucumber
- 1/4 cup of diced onion
- 1/4 cup of chopped fresh parsley
- 1/4 cup of chopped fresh mint leaves
- 2 freshly squeezed lemons
- 1 tbsp of olive oil (if available, I sub the olive oil for Kalamata Olives)
- 1 clove of garlic, minced
- Salt (Himalayan Pink) and pepper to taste (and [Tony Chachereâ€™s Original Creole Seasoning](https://amzn.to/3j9DuY6) IYKYK)

### FYI
An easy way to preserve an excess of fresh parsley or mint is to chop the leaves and tightly wrap them into a ball. Then cover the ball with plastic wrap and store it in the freezer. To use it in future recipes that call for chopped parsley or mint, take it out of the freezer and use a zester to add it.

## Instructions
1. Rinse the quinoa thoroughly and then add it to a saucepan with 2 cups water or vegetable broth. Bring it to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 15-20 minutes or until the quinoa is tender and the liquid is absorbed.
2. When the quinoa finishes cooking, remove it from the heat and let it cool.
3. Mix the cooked quinoa, microgreens (and other veggies), diced tomatoes, cucumber, onion, parsley, and mint leaves.
4. In a small bowl, whisk together lemon juice, olive oil, minced garlic, salt, and pepper (and Tony Chachereâ€™s Creole Seasoning or what I like to call the secret seasoning).
5. Pour the dressing over the quinoa mixture and toss to combine.
6. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.
7. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed before serving.

**Bon appÃ©tit! I hope you enjoy your Quinoa Tabbouleh**
