## Lyrics

Hit it!

You might be close in such a easy game never before hmmm
But your playing with fire when you wrote your name in my book
Don't you believe what you see I'm not like the other guy
I'm here to warn you baby there is
Something you don't realize mmm, yeah,

Armed and dangerous (I think you better watch your step)
Armed and dangerous (You dealing with something else)
Will you take the risk baby 'cause I'm
Armed and dangerous (armed and dangerous)

My finger's dead on the trigger I've got your heart in my sites
So how come you keep on working till
Your close to the dawning light hey yeah

Armed and dangerous (I think you better watch your step)
Armed and dangerous (You dealing with someone else)
Will you take the risk (Take the risk) baby 'cause I'm armed (
I'm armed Baby I'm armed and dangerous I'm armed and dangerous)

Love hits your right between the eyes
You'll learn that love was in disguise surprise

(Sax solo)

Armed and dangerous (Are you sure you want to take me home)
Armed and dangerous (You'll be dealing in a danger zone)
Will you take the risk baby 'cause I'm armed and dangerous wooo

Dada, dada do, do, do dada, dada (repeat 6 times)

Armed and dangerous (woo you better watch your step yeah)
Armed and dangerous (you'll be dealing with someone else yeah)
Will you take the risk (ooh) baby 'cause
I'm armed (armed and armed and dangerous) and
Armed and dangerous (no matter what you say girl)
Armed and dangerous (your gonna be dealing with someone else)
Will you take the risk (take the risk) baby cause
(I'm armed armed and dangerous) I'm armed and dangerous
Armed and dangerous
