## Level 0: the Bare _minimum_ EDC

> Phone, keys, wallet

I _try to_ chant that phrase every time I leave the house, which usually works well, but only when I remember to chant it. Luckily, I can get by if I just remember my phone, especially with the increasing prevalence of digital door locks and [ApplePay](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-wallet/id1160481993). Since I usually need my keys to drive, the item I forget the most is my physical wallet which holds my ID and emergency cash.

### Phone 
<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/shecodez/image/upload/v1672604591/vvifi_fyi%20blog/IMG_0091.jpg" alt="my iPhone 11" />

[My iPhone 11, white, 128GB](https://amzn.to/3YXPL25)

I‚Äôm still rocking the [iPhone 11](https://amzn.to/3YXPL25) 128GB model in white. Honestly, I haven't seen a strong enough reason to upgrade to a newer iPhone version, but I did "_upgrade_" it to support MagSafe accessories. If you got ten (10) bucks and an iPhone 11 but want the MagSafe support that the iPhone 12 and newer models have? [Here‚Äôs how I added MagSafe support to my old iPhone 11 with a ten (10) dollar sticker](https://vvifi.fyi/blog/wtf/upgrade-your-iphone-11-to-support-magsafe-with-a-sticker).


### Keys (Keyring)
I have everything but keys attached to my keyring at the moment. 

only have a car key and the key to detach my [Slades](https://www.flaneurz.com/en/slades/home) on the ring that came with my [mini stun gun](https://vvifi.fyi/blog/edc/mini-stun-gun-disguised-as-a-key-fob). However, the [black Orbitkey Crazy-Horse leather key organizer](https://www.orbitkey.com/collections/key-organiser/products/key-organiser-crazy-horse?variant=32375375822944) paired with the [black Orbitkey Slim Case for AirTag](https://www.orbitkey.com/products/airtag-case?_pos=1&_sid=387da0d8a&_ss=r&variant=39382282010720) is on my wishlist to get when I get more keys or if I catch it on sale. üòâ

### A MagSafe Wallet that supports Apple's Find My service
A good EDC wallet, in my opinion, is ultra-slim, stylish, and RFID-blocking. The MagSafe Wallet with Find My by Apple is ridiculously slim, minimal, and RFID-blocking. I like that the wallet notifies the user when and where it detaches from the back of the iPhone. Alas, it doesn‚Äôt quite work like Apple‚Äôs AirTags which can "phone home" via Apple's Find My network. Hopefully, that‚Äôs a future feature. The MagSafe Wallet costs $59 on Apple's website and comes in Golden Brown, Dark Cherry, Sequoia Green, Midnight, and Wisteria (I went with midnight). It‚Äôs not perfect, but _if you have an iPhone 12 or a later version_*, it should help you forget your physical wallet less often. 

> So I bought the Apple MagSafe wallet to go with my iPhone 11. The new wallet has an NFC chip which enables support for Apple's [Find My](https://www.apple.com/icloud/find-my/) service. Silly me thought: if I get a magnetic sticker and attach it to my old yet still NFC-enabled iPhone 11, I should be able to use the new wallet with my old phone. But of course, that didn‚Äôt work out because Apple purposely made it so the iPhone 11 and earlier models **won‚Äôt** (not can‚Äôt) read the NFC chip in the wallet. ü§¨

## Level 1: the Basic EDC

Now it‚Äôs time to advance an EDC level and add more utility to our bare _minimum_ 3-item EDC. Although the Basic EDC is not quite as essential as the Bare _minimum_ EDC, not having these Basic EDC items every time I go out tends to throw off my whole day; that‚Äôs how much value carrying these items adds to my everyday life.

### Pen
It‚Äôs almost 2023, and we still have to write things down on paper. üò± Digital all the things already! I‚Äôm kidding (mostly). Sometimes nothing beats having a good pen to paper, whether for filling out tedious paperwork, making [Bored Ape]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bored_Ape) doodles during a meeting, or physically signing your life away. _As if we all don‚Äôt digitally sign our lives away a [googol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googol) times a day._ 

I‚Äôm using the [Kikkerland 4-In-1 Pen Tool](https://amzn.to/3i764Je) as my budget EDC pen. It  Measures 5.8 by 1.6 by 1.4 inches and includes
Black ink ballpoint pen
Ruler (cm and in)
Philips and Flat head screw-driver (under the cap)
Bubble Level
It's not the most solid EDC pen, but since it costs less than five dollars, it fits the _budget_ bill quite nicely. Note: the pen color is chosen randomly during the time of shipping. I wanted black but got silver. Thanks, RNJesus. üôèüèæ

### Power bank
I view a power bank as an annoying paperweight until I need it, then it becomes a gift from the goddess. I remember one time in Tokyo, my phone died, and I didn‚Äôt have a power bank. I also didn‚Äôt speak Japanese very well (I still don‚Äôt), and I needed to contact my friend. In the distance, I spotted a pay phone. I‚Äôd never even used a pay phone in the US, let alone in Japan. Although I figured it out, I also vowed never again. Glad I was in Japan when this happened because I never felt like I was in danger from being alone in the big city. However, I wouldn‚Äôt have felt nearly as safe alone in New York City with a dead phone. I bought my (generic no name) power bank a while ago, so, unfortunately, I can‚Äôt link the exact one on Amazon.

### Knife / Multi-tool
Can you believe the [Gerber Gear 12-in-1 Dime -  Black](https://www.gerbergear.com/en-us/shop/multi-tools/all-multi-tools/dime-black-30-000469) multi-tool was only $17.40 on Black Friday? But I waited too late to buy it üò≠, so instead of being on this list, it‚Äôs on my watch list. üëÄ Meantime, the  [Tac-Force- Spring Assisted Folding Pocket Knife ‚Äì Rainbow](https://amzn.to/3vwNbT4) is my best budget EDC knife. It‚Äôs a TiNite-coated stainless steel blade with a bottle opener, glass punch, and pocket clip. **TL;DR** the [knife](https://amzn.to/3vwNbT4) looks bad-@$$, the aluminum handle feels solid, it does more than stab and cut things, and best of all, it‚Äôs budget-friendly.

### Watch

</div>

I never understood why people bought smartwatches, but I have since seen de light and de way. It took 5 (almost 6) iterations of the Apple watch for me to finally break down and buy the Apple Watch Series-4 40MM in space gray (whilst a budget, we don't need the latest and greatest). I‚Äôm always learning about fun new features it can do in addition to keeping track of time, so far I‚Äôve discovered:
- It can display my boarding pass after adding it to the Apple Wallet app
- If the phone rings in another room, I can still answer the call via the watch 
- It unlocks my MacBook by proximity 
- If I misplace my phone, I can make the phone beep via the watch
- If I pull up maps on my phone, the watch will direct me without me looking at the phone
- It reminds me to stand up and take a breather throughout the day
- I can change the watch face and band as often as I want to match my mood

### Flashlight
I don‚Äôt have a dedicated flashlight in my budget EDC. üò≤ But wait, hear me out for a beginner budget EDC the convenience of the flashlight app that ships with most smartphones works well enough for me. Instead, I fill that spot with a little black [pill container](https://amzn.to/3Q8KiBd) full of drugs?! Specifically painkillers like Tylenol (acetaminophen), Motrin (ibuprofen), and Pamprin.

## Level 2: the Big Boy/Girl EDC

### Mask
Since the start of the ‚ÄòRona, my Bare _minimum_ EDC was: phone, keys, wallet‚Ä¶ [mask](https://amzn.to/3Gx9nCG). Now with restrictions (or strong suggestions if you live in the US) lifted, I still always carry one, even if I‚Äôm not required to wear it anymore.

### Hand sanitizer
Even before the ‚ÄòRona, if I‚Äôm not carrying a [hand sanitizer](https://amzn.to/3X20WVD) with me, I always have some nearby. I always keep a bottle of it in my car, my gym bag, in my suitcase for when I travel, and before WFH (work from home), I used to keep a bottle at my desk. 

### Bare _minimum_ first aid kit
The absolute essentials required to clean, sterilize, and protect minor injuries and papercuts (how can something so small hurt so darn much?!):
- Alcohol wipes
- Topical antibiotic 
- Adhesive bandages

### Condom

## Level 3: the Baddie EDC üî•

Until now, the EDC has been unisex, but now it‚Äôs time to make it **Her EDC**.

### Self-defense tool/weapon
My self-defense weapon choice is a [mini stun gun that looks like a car key fob](https://amzn.to/3WKyuba). I wrote an article on it [here](https://vvifi.fyi/blog/edc/mini-stun-gun/diguised-as-a-key-fob).

### Her _period_ EDC
I have a different little pouch I start carrying when it's close to that time of the month. I only keep a panty liner and a reusable [Flex Menstrual Disc](https://amzn.to/3Q6RygZ). I used to carry a pad, but, to be more eco-friendly, I switched to disposable plant-based discs. ‚ôªÔ∏è

### Misc

> ‚Äúeverything but the kitchen sink.‚Äù 

Here are my current favorite miscellaneous budget EDC items. *Except for the Quip refillable floss pick, each item was 10 dollars or less, so if you see it for more than ten dollars, wait for it to go on sale because you know I didn‚Äôt pay that much for it üíÖüèΩ:
