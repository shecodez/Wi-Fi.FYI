## How does a stun gun work?
If you're looking for a way to protect yourself, a stun gun can be an excellent non-lethal self-defense option! The stun gun works by locking up the body's muscles and "jamming" the electrical signals of the central nervous system. The shock quickly converts blood sugar into lactic acid within seconds and causes the attacker to fall, become disoriented, or be confused and gives you the time you need to disengage and escape to safety.

### FYI #1
**High voltage does not equal power**. The voltage doesn‚Äôt even matter; the amperage (current) is what kills. An electrical outlet, for example, one in the US, typically has 120 volts but between 15-20 amps. It only takes one (1) amp to kill a person. Stun guns run off high voltage but low amperage to disable rather than kill someone.

## Pros and cons of using stun guns in self-defense
Pro: Stun guns work in all weather, including the wind and rain (unlike pepper spray). Con: a stun gun probably isn‚Äôt the best option for a person who is physically weak and easily overpowered. Be careful because you could be reverse Uno-ed if the attacker takes the stun gun and directs it back at you. Luckily some stun guns are designed with a safety feature that disables the device if pulled away from its wrist strap. Con: stun guns require close proximity and pain compliance to work, not to be confused with a TASER. Pro: today's stun guns can be small and discreet but still deliver a high-voltage punch with the element of surprise.

### FYI #2
_Neither a stun gun nor a TASER device is designed to knock someone out or render them unconscious_. Normally 1 second of stun gun contact will repel and startle an attacker. A 1-2 second shock will cause minor muscle spasms and put your attacker into a dazed mental state. 3 to 5 seconds causes the desired loss of balance, muscle control, mental confusion, and disorientation/nausea.

## Can the voltage transfer between me and the attacker?
The short answer is no. Upon impact with the skin, **the muscles take in the energy from the stun gun**, making it impossible for the electricity to convert from the attacker to you. Since stun guns require you to be near your attacker, this is good news.

### FYI #3
You‚Äôve probably heard a stun gun referred to as a "taser" or vice-versa. The word "taser" has become a genericized trademark like the words "Mace" for pepper spray or ‚ÄúGoogle‚Äù for search. The stun gun is a direct contact electroshock weapon for self-defense that relies on pain to work. A TASER is a brand-name electronic control device (ECD). An EDC device immobilizes a target by overriding the central nervous system via neuromuscular incapacitation. TASERs execute this with barbed dart cartridges that can shoot up to 15 feet away from a target. 
**TL;DR**: TASER = _long-range control_, and stun gun = _point-blank pain_ . I know it's confusing, especially since guns are usually long-range weapons. English üôÑ

## Tips on how to use the stun gun effectively
- **Aim for the skin** ‚Äì press the stun gun firmly against the attacker‚Äôs skin. Aim for the hands, neck, face, or arms because there is a chance it won‚Äôt be able to penetrate some clothing.
- **Apply for a few seconds at a minimum** ‚Äì Alas, electroshock devices do not work instantly with the slightest touch. You must press it firmly against the attacker for at least several seconds.
- **Be cautious of tough guys** ‚Äì Some people have a high pain tolerance and can withstand an electrical shock, so it‚Äôs best to have a backup plan or product prepared to use in conjunction with the stun gun, like pepper spray or a knife.

### FYI #4
It is important to remember that anything can fail. The same holds for a stun gun or any self-defense electroshock weapon. Since stun guns are pain compliance tools, **it has been recommended you do NOT use them against people with a high tolerance to pain**. That includes those under the influence, on drugs, or mentally psychotic. In these instances, a stun gun will only make the attacker more aggressive and potentially go into "_kill mode_."

## How do I know which stun gun is right for me?
It can be overwhelming to choose one with so many options on the market. Plus, I realize everyone has different situations and circumstances, so I can only tell you which one _I_ chose and _why_. I went with this one from [Amazon](https://amzn.to/3WKyuba) and here's why:

1. **It has a mini form factor** - I wanted something small and light that [attaches to my keychain via magnet](https://amzn.to/3GxRhk7) for quick and inconspicuous removal. üéµ ‚Äúdon't be suspicious, don't be suspicious.‚Äù 
2. **It has a flashlight** - which admittedly kind of sucks, but in a pinch, a crappy little light is better than no light.
3. **It‚Äôs discreet** - it looks just like a car key fob. I don't want to broadcast, ‚ÄúLooky üëÄ I have an electroshock weapon!‚Äù just so the attacker can come at me guarded against it.

Although the stun gun I chose has my main requirements (mini and discrete), I want to note it does not have the following:
1. A disable-pin wrist strap safety feature
2. ‚Äú_Shark teeth_‚Äù are electrical barbs designed to collect the attacker's DNA on contact. 
3. A panic alarm

So I‚Äôm still looking for a stun gun that does:

### FYI #5
**Owning a stun gun is not legal in all 50 states**. In some states, it‚Äôs illegal, while others require a concealed carry permit. To complicate things more, the laws regulating them can vary from state to state and even city to city within the state. You should learn the [stun gun laws](https://www.departmentofselfdefense.com/pages/stun-gun-restrictions) in your local city/state and those you plan to travel to for work or vacation. 
**Note**: It is illegal to carry any self-defense weapon on an airplane in your personal item or carry-on luggage.
