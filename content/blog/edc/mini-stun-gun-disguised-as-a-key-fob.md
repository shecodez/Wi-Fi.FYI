## How does a stun gun work?
If you're looking for a way to protect yourself, a stun gun can be an excellent non-lethal self-defense option! The stun gun works by locking up the body's muscles and "jamming" the electrical signals of the central nervous system. The shock quickly converts blood sugar into lactic acid and within seconds this can cause the attacker to fall down, become disoriented, or confused to give you the time you need to quickly disengage and escape to safety.

### FYI #1
High voltage does not equal power. In fact, voltage doesn‚Äôt even really matter; it‚Äôs the amperage (current) that kills. An electrical outlet, for example one in the US, typically has 120 volts but between 15-20 amps. It only takes one (1) amp to kill a person. Stun guns run off of high voltage, but low amperage in order to disable rather than kill someone.

## Pros and cons of using stun guns in self-defense
Pro: Stun guns work in all weather including the wind and rain (unlike pepper spray). Con: a stun gun may not be the best option for a person who is physically weak and easily overpowered. If you‚Äôre not careful you could end up reverse uno-ed if the attacker takes the stun gun and directs it back at you. Luckily some stun guns are designed with a safety feature that disables the device if it‚Äôs pulled away from its wrist strap. Con: stun guns require close proximity and pain compliance to work, not to be confused with a TASER. Pro: today's stun guns can be very small and discreet but still deliver a high voltage punch with the element of surprise.

### FYI #2
_Neither a stun gun nor a TASER device is designed to knock someone out or render them unconscious_. Normally 1 second of stun gun contact will repel and startle an attacker. A 1-2 second shock will cause minor muscle spasms and put your attacker into a dazed mental state. 3 to 5 seconds will cause a desired loss of balance, muscle control, mental confusion and disorientation/nausea.

## Can the voltage transfer between me and the attacker?
The short answer is no. Upon impact with the skin **the muscles take in the energy from the stun gun**, making it impossible for the electricity to convert from the attacker to you. Since stun guns require you to be in close proximity to your attacker this is definitely good news.

### FYI #3
You‚Äôve probably heard a stun gun being referred to as a "taser" or "tazer", or vice-versa. The word "taser" has become a _genericized trademark_ much like the words "Mace" for pepper spray, or ‚ÄúGoogle‚Äù for search. The stun gun is a direct contact electroshock weapon for self-defense that relies on pain to work. A TASER is a brand of electronic control device (ECD) that immobilizes a target by overriding the central nervous system via neuromuscular incapacitation. TASERs execute this through the use of barbed dart cartridges that can shoot up to 15 feet away from a target. 
**TL;DR**: _TASER = long range control and stun gun = point blank pain_. Why the names are not reversed, especially since guns are usually long ranged weapons, I'll never know‚Ä¶ English üôÑ

## Tips on how to use the stun gun effectively
- **Aim for the skin** ‚Äì try to push the stun gun as firmly as you can against the skin of the attacker. Aim for the hands, neck, face or arms because there is a chance it won‚Äôt be able to penetrate certain clothing.
- **Apply for a few seconds at minimum** ‚Äì Alas, electroshock devices do not work instantly with the slightest touch. You will need to press it firmly against the attacker for at least several seconds for it to work.
- **Be cautious of tough guys** ‚Äì Some people have a high pain tolerance and can withstand the electrical shock so it‚Äôs best to have a back-up plan or product prepared to use in conjunction with the stun gun like pepper spray or a knife.

### FYI #4
It is important to remember that anything can fail. The same holds true for a stun gun or any self-defense electroshock weapon. Since they are pain compliance tools, it is **not recommended for use against people with a high tolerance to pain**. That includes those under the influence, on drugs or mentally psychotic. In these instances a stun gun will only serve to make the attacker more aggressive and potentially go into "kill mode."

## How do I know which stun gun is right for me?
I know it can be overwhelming because with so many options on the market. Plus I realize, everyone has different situations and circumstances so I can only tell you which one I chose and why. Maybe my requirements will align with some of yours. I went with this one from [Amazon](https://amzn.to/3iKd7aF). and here's why:

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B3TPPTPP?th=1&linkCode=li2&tag=vvifi-20&linkId=ad2670f0b88afec4e1ba93a943a7f6b6&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_il" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B0B3TPPTPP&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=vvifi-20&language=en_US" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=vvifi-20&language=en_US&l=li2&o=1&a=B0B3TPPTPP" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

1. **It's mini sized** - I wanted something small that would go on my keychain and not as obvious as some of the other models. ‚Äúdon't be suspicious don't be suspicious‚Äù 
2. **It has a flashlight** - which admittedly kind of sucks, but in a pinch a crappy little light is better than no light at all.
3. **It‚Äôs discreet** - it looks just like a car key fob. I don't want to broadcast ‚ÄúLooky üëÄ I have an electroshock weapon‚Äù just so the attacker can come at me already guarded against it.

Although the stun gun I chose has my main requirements (small and discrete), I want to note it does not have the following:
1. A disable pin wrist strap safety feature
2. ‚ÄúShark teeth‚Äù electrical barbs designed to collect the attackers DNA on contact. 
3. A panic alarm

So I‚Äôm still on the lookout for a stun gun that do all the things.

### FYI #5
**Owning a stun gun is not legal in all 50 states**. In some states it‚Äôs completely illegal while others require a concealed carry permit. To complicate things more, the laws regulating them can vary from state to state and even city to city within the same state. It‚Äôs extremely important you know the [stun gun laws](https://www.departmentofselfdefense.com/pages/stun-gun-restrictions) in your local city/state and those you plan to travel to for work or vacation. 
**Note**: It is illegal to carry any self-defense weapon on an airplane in your personal item or carry-on luggage.
