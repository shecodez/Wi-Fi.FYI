description: How I upgraded my old iPhone 11 support MagSafe like the iPhone 12 and later versions without paying the new iPhone price
---

## Introduction
So I bought the Apple MagSafe wallet to go with my iPhone 11. The new wallet has an NFC chip which enables support for Apple's [Find My](https://www.apple.com/icloud/find-my/) service. Silly me thought: if I get a magnetic sticker and attach it to my old yet still NFC-enabled iPhone 11, I should be able to use the new wallet with my old phone. But of course, that didn‚Äôt work out because Apple purposely made it so the iPhone 11 and earlier models **won‚Äôt** (not can‚Äôt) read the NFC chip in the wallet. ü§¨

With the DIY MagSafe ‚Äòupgrade', Although I decided to switch to [another case](https://amzn.to/3Gv1HRs), I wanted to pay homage to the [UAG (Urban Armor Gear) case](https://amzn.to/3Q4Dxk5) I've had on it since Nov 2018. It has protected my phone from all the bumps, scrapes, and drops until now (Dec 2022) and is still going strong. Now my phone is so old I don't _feel_ it needs such a heavy-duty case anymore, so I went with a lighter one.

> I don't feel it needs such a heavy-duty case anymore, so I went with a lighter one.

If only I could go back in time and stop myself from doing this 'upgrade'; not only did I waste money on an overpriced Apple wallet that **won't** work with my iPhone 11, 
- I bought a new case (granted, it was super cheap, like four dollars). 
- I spent ten whole bucks on a sticker driving my OCD nuts since the apple logo is not in the center of the circle of magnets. 
- I busted up my last screen protector ‚Äìit‚Äôs my favorite brand, and it‚Äôs discontinued. üò¢

### FYI
So here‚Äôs the tea üçµ: less than a few seconds after I finished changing the phone case, I dropped it on the corner of my glass wrist rest trying to test the magnet strength of the wallet. Luckily I still had a tempered glass screen protector on it, and I'm glad the screen protector took the brunt of the damage, but now I'm stuck because I can't find a replacement for the OCOMMO Premium Japanese Tempered Glass, Full Coverage 3D Screen Protector with Mesh Dust Guard on Amazon. üò≠

## Conclusion
If you're adding MagSafe support to your phone, just make sure you don't do what I did. üòÜ Although I can't use MagSafe for what I intended to use it for, I do benefit from having it to use with many other MagSafe accessories like a MagSafe power bank, or phone stand. So will you be tackling this DIY 'upgrade'? What accessories will you be using? Please share it in the comment section below.
