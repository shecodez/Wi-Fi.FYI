description: open doors (of the non-knob variety), press buttons, and reduce the number of germ-infested surfaces you come into contact with daily with no-touch tools
---

Have you ever really thought about all the surfaces you touch every day? From door handles to buttons/keypads to touch screens, we are exposed to countless germs and viruses daily. This exposure is especially concerning during cold and flu season, all while the ‚ÄòRona has not had a season finale yet. That's where no-touch tools come in. These innovative tools allow us to avoid direct contact with potentially contaminated surfaces, reducing the risk of getting sick and helping to prevent the spread of illness.

### FYI #1
Top 3 germiest surfaces you probably touch regularly ü§¢
1. **Grocery cart handles** - According to the University of Arizona microbiologist Charles Gerba, Ph.D., about 70 to 80 percent of grocery carts tested across the country are contaminated with E. coli.
2. **Buttons** - are ubiquitous (keyboards, elevators, and vending machines, to name a few) and thus hard to avoid. Watch out for that 1st-floor button in the elevator because while not everyone goes up to the same floor, they all must come down to the first floor.
3. **Safety handles and handrails** - perhaps just as ubiquitous as buttons, things people can hold on to are necessary for most public spaces to comply with safety regulations. The Kimberly-Clark study found 43 percent of escalator rails were highly contaminated.

**Honorable mention**: Family. Friends. You.

## What is a no-touch tool?

A no-touch tool is often a thin key-like device a few inches long that can be attached to your keychain.  It employs a simple design with a hook on one end to open doors and a tip on the other to push buttons; bonus: those with a stylus tip can allow you to write with it on touchscreens. Most no-touch tools use copper, or brass, a copper alloy, in their construction. 

> ‚ÄúCopper and copper alloys, like brass and bronze, are inherently antimicrobial,‚Äù 
‚Äì Adam Estelle, director of rod & bar at the [Copper Development Association](https://www.copper.org/) 

### FYI #2
According to an [April 2020 study](https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMc2004973) by the New England Journal of Medicine found that copper exposed to SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) was only measurable on the copper for _four hours_. However, the virus can live on plastic and even stainless steel for up to _three days_. So copper can **not** kill the virus on contact, but the surface is inhospitable for the virus to live on for more than four (4) hours.

## Benefits of using no-touch tools

There are numerous pros to using no-touch tools in our daily lives. For one, they can help improve personal hygiene by reducing the germs and viruses we come into contact with, which reduces the risk of getting sick. No-touch tools help to prevent the spread of illness, as they reduce the number of germs and viruses transmitted from person to person. I found using them in public spaces, where germs easily spread from one surface to another, especially beneficial.

## Why I went with Limitless GOLDKEY
> ‚ÄúYes, [no-touch tools] can serve as that important in-between keeping your bare hands from touching an infected surface‚Äîand given enough time, viruses will die on copper [which is a component of brass]. But if you‚Äôre just tossing the tool back into your pocket or bag after you use it, you could still be exposing yourself to what you‚Äôre trying to avoid.‚Äù

You could purchase one of the more heavily-influenced-on-Instagram brands like the Peel Touch Tool or the Keysmart CleanKey. üí∏ However (IMO), [Limitless GOLDKEY](https://amzn.to/3ibEgU7) beats all the competition by having something as simple as a containment cover to place on the exposed part after use. Not to mention it cost less than five dollars.

The [Limitless Innovations GOLDKEY package](https://amzn.to/3ibEgU7) contains
- 1x Antimicrobial Hand Tool & Styles
- 1x Antimicrobial Containment Case
- 1x Retractable Carabiner
- 1x Quick Release Keychain (this kind of sucks NGL)

**Note**: Instead of the Quick Release Keychain that comes with GOLDKEY, I prefer to use the [KeySmart MagConnect Quick Release Keychain Connector](https://amzn.to/3GgccHc).

## Do you _need_ a no-touch tool?
No, but the [Limitless GOLDKEY Antimicrobial hand tool & stylus](https://amzn.to/3ibEgU7) is invaluable for **reducing** the number of germ-infested surfaces we come into contact with daily. Whether you're looking to help soothe your germophobia or prevent the spread of illness, no-touch tools can help. Consider incorporating a no-touch tool (that you don‚Äôt have to break the bank for) into your daily carry. But remember to practice other precautions like thoroughly washing your hands with soap & water / using hand sanitizer, and wearing a mask in public to protect yourself and others.

### FYI #3
I‚Äôm all about eco-friendly ‚ôªÔ∏è DIY alternatives to consumer products so here‚Äôs a recipe and instructions for a DIY Hand Sanitizer.

Ingredients:
- 2/3 cup 99% rubbing alcohol
- 1/3 cup aloe vera gel
- Optional: a few drops of essential oil (such as tea tree, lavender, or peppermint) for fragrance

Instructions:
1. In a small bowl or container, mix the rubbing alcohol and aloe vera gel until well combined.
2. If desired, add a few drops of essential oil and mix well.
3. Transfer the mixture to a clean, empty container with a tight-fitting lid.
4. To use, apply a small amount of the hand sanitizer to the palms of your hands and rub them together until dry.

**Note**: This hand sanitizer recipe is intended, for use, when soap and water are unavailable. It is not a substitute for washing your hands with soap and water.
