**Requiem from the Darkness** (京極夏彦 巷説百物語, _Kyōgoku Natsuhiko Kōsetsu Hyaku Monogatari_, lit. "Natsuhiko Kyogoku's Hundred Stories") is a horror and mystery anime series produced by **TMS Entertainment**, directed by **Hideki Tonokatsu** and written by **Yoshinobu Fujioka**.

## Plot 4/5
The plot revolves around a writer named **Momosuke Yamaoka**, who has grown tired of writing riddles for children, and plans to instead document tales of the strange and supernatural and publish them in an anthology called _Hyakumonogatari_ ("One Hundred Tales"). As Momosuke delves deeper into these stories, he begins to uncover a darker and more sinister truth. The series explores themes of horror and the supernatural, as well as the darker aspects of human nature.

### FYI

## Voice Acting 4/5
The voice actors do a great job of bringing the characters to life and adding depth to the story. 

## Animation Style 3.5/5
The animation is of good quality, but it is not the most visually stunning anime out there.

## Characters 4/5
The characters are well-developed and interesting, but some viewers might find them to be a bit stereotypical. 

## Music 4/5
The music by **Kuniaki Haijima** is fitting and helps to create a spooky atmosphere.

## Overall Rating 4/5
Overall, **Requiem from the Darkness** is a great horror and supernatural anime series that should appeal to fans of the genre. If you're looking for something that is both creepy and thought-provoking, then this anime is definitely worth checking out. However, it may not be suitable for viewers who are sensitive to graphic violence and disturbing imagery.
